# PRUClarity Multi-Agent Insurance Recommendation

This project uses multi-agent reasoning and vector search to recommend PRUShield insurance plans tailored to a client's life stages.

## Features

- Extracts client profile data from MyInfo API
- Generates projected life stages using LLM agents
- Retrieves relevant insurance information from PDFs using vector search
- Recommends PRUShield and PRUExtra Copay plans for each life stage
- Interactive Streamlit frontend for visualization

## Folder Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit frontend for displaying results
- `multiagent_insurance.ipynb` — Main notebook for running agents and generating recommendations
- `docs/` — Contains PRUShield product PDFs for knowledge base
- `result.json` — Output file with recommendations (generated by notebook)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the notebook to generate `result.json`:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook multiagent_insurance.ipynb
    ```

3. Start the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

- The notebook fetches sample client data, builds life stages, and recommends insurance plans.
- The Streamlit app visualizes the client profile, life stages, and recommended plans.

## Notes

- Ensure `result.json` is generated before running the Streamlit app.
- PDF files in `docs/` are used for insurance knowledge retrieval.
